# ULS-Inc
Location for the ULS Inc Computer Science Project


Goal of the Project:
A dungeon crawler that takes you through multiple rooms, ending with a final boss room.

For testing: Use CodePen
- copy the Game.js code into one pen, then link it to the Main.js in another pen
- link the Dungeon.js to the Game pen from a seperate pen
- Replace all ".js" files with links to codepens, and ".png" files with links to the png in the resources
